Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by
Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its simplicity,
extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and
carefully chosen typography.

Tufte CSS was created by [Dave Liepmann][dl] and is now an Edward Tufte project.
The original idea was cribbed from
[Tufte-<span class="latex">L<span class="latex-sup">a</span>T<span
class="latex-sub">e</span>X</span>][tufte-latex] and [R Markdown's Tufte Handout
format][r-markdown]. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have
contributed to those projects.

If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution
in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: [tufte-css].
Please note the [contribution guidelines][contrib].

Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print.
Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say
"websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte's books" but rather
"here are some techniques Tufte developed that we've found useful in print;
maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web". Tufte CSS is merely
a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a
starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their
information as best suits their particular circumstances.

</section>


## Getting Started

To use Tufte CSS, copy `tufte.css` and the `et-book` directory of font files to
your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document's `head`
block:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/>
```

Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions
described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element
frequently.


## Fundamentals

### Sections and Headings

Organize your document with an `article` element inside your `body` tag. Inside
that, use `section` tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.

Tufte CSS uses `h1` for the document title, `p` with class `subtitle` for the
document subtitle, `h2` for section headings, and `h3` for low-level headings.
More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a
heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:

> [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of
> physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters
> and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of
> <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>,
> rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very
> complicated material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to
> organize.

> </footer>

As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of
block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct
HTML using `blockquote` and `footer` elements. See page 20 of [The Visual
Display of Quantitative Information][vdqi] for an example in print.

[vdqi]: https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi

<span class="newthought">In his later books</span>[^1], Tufte starts each
section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first
few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the
class `newthought`, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical
spacing is accomplished separately through `<section>` tags. Be consistent:
though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not
alternate use of header elements and the `newthought` technique. Pick one
approach and stick to it.

### Text

Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is
better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS
uses `#fffff8` and `#111111` because they are nearly indistinguishable from
their 'pure' cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the
greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and
images.

In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo[^2] font. A similar
effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source
[ETBook][et-book], which Tufte CSS supplies with a `@font-face`
reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn't work, Tufte CSS shifts
gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.

[^2]:
  See Tufte's comment in the [Tufte book fonts][bembo-thread] thread.

[bembo-thread]: http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt
[et-book]: https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book

Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and
italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform
the text. This is typographic best practice.

<p class="sans">
If you prefer sans-serifs, use the `sans` class. It relies on Gill Sans,
Tufte's sans-serif font of choice.
</p>

Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover
or when clicked. Here is a [dummy example](#) that goes nowhere.
These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator
of clickable text. [^blue] However, because most browsers' default underlining
does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect
is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of
standard `text-decoration`. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.

[^blue]:
  {-} Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is
  crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of
  underlining.

As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides
by default. Other approaches, such as changing color on click or mouseover, or
using highlighting or color instead of underlining to denote links, could also
be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference
from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web
users.


## Epigraphs

<div class="epigraph">

> The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts
> are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to
> have foolish thoughts.
>
> <footer>George Orwell, "Politics and the English Language"</footer>

<!-- break blockquote -->

> For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public
> relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.
>
> <footer>
> Richard P. Feynman, <cite>"What Do You Care What Other People Think?"</cite>
> </footer>

<!-- break blockquote -->

> I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.
>
> <footer>
> Henri Matisse, <cite>Henri Matisse Dessins: th√®mes et variations</cite>
> (Paris, 1943), 37
> </footer>

</div>

If you'd like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes,
use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte's books (particularly
*Beautiful Evidence*), these are `blockquote` elements with a bit of specialized
styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a `footer` element inside
the `blockquote`. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this
section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph
tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the
use of a wrapper class.

## Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes

One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of
sidenotes.[^3] Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don't force the reader
to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side
in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You
are very astute.

[^3]: This is a sidenote.

Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently
large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and
small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are
hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related
but not necessary information such as asides or citations *as close as possible*
to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information
should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of
ideas in the main text.

Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes
inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put
a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go,
like so:

```
<label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
```

You must manually assign a reference `id` to each side or margin note, replacing
"sn-demo" in the `for` and the `id` attribute values with an appropriate
descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like `sn-` for sidenotes and `mn-` for
margin notes.

Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the
sidenote content itself, in a `span` with class `sidenote`. This tag is also
inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the
margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by
keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.

If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin
note.[^mn] On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the
reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow
of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note
to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a
sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference
number. This document currently uses the symbol ‚äï (`&\#8853;`), but it's up to
you.

[^mn]:
  {-} This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note.

Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the `marginnote` class
for the content and the `margin-toggle` class for the label and dummy checkbox.
For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous
paragraph:

```
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn‚Äôt a number preceding the note.
</span>
```

Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next
section.


## Figures

Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and
figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they
are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of
graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or
scrolling.

Figures should try to use the `figure` element, which by default are constrained
to the main column. Don't wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin
note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the
time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion,
like so:


<figure>
^[{-} From Edward Tufte, *Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, page 92.]
![Exports and Imports to and from Denmark & Norway from 1700 to 1780](img/exports-imports.png)
</figure>

[^rhino] But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte's work
even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of
those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the
margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a
<code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.

[^rhino]:
  {-} ![Image of a Rhinoceros](img/rhino.png) F.J. Cole, "The History of Albrecht
  D√ºrer's Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature," *Science, Medicine, and
  History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice*
  (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward
  Tufte's *Visual Explanations*.

If you need a full-width figure, give it the `fullwidth` class. Make sure that's
inside an `article`, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen.
This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte's English translation of
the Napoleon's March data visualization. From *Beautiful Evidence*, page
122-124.

<figure class="fullwidth">

campaign, 1812-1813](img/napoleons-march.png)
</figure>


## Code

Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with
the `code` class, as I've been using in this document to denote
HTML. Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code
analysis, but it must maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS
follows GitHub's font selection, which shifts gracefully along the monospace
spectrum from the elegant but rare Consolas all the way to good old reliable
Courier.

Extended code examples should use a `pre` tag with class
`code`. This adds control over indentation and overflow as well:

```
;; Some code examples in Clojure. This is a comment.

(map tufte-css blog-posts)
;;;; if unfamiliar, see http://www.lispcast.com/annotated-map

;; side-effecty loop (unformatted, causing text overflow) - from https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2) (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))] (prn (* b d)))

;; that same side-effecty loop, formatted
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list
                   (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2)
                   (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))]
(prn (* b d)))

## ImageQuilts

Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartz's
[ImageQuilts]. See the [ET forum announcement thread][quilts-thread] for more on
quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as
you would any other `figure`.

[ImageQuilts]: http://imagequilts.com/
[quilts-thread]: http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003wk

This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width
figure to accomodate its girth:

<figure class="fullwidth">
![Image of Chinese Calligraphy](img/imagequilt-chinese-calligraphy.png)
</figure>

Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained
to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of
course still rectangular.

<figure>

## Epilogue

Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. It is only
through his kind and careful editing that this project accomplishes what it
does. All errors of implementation are of course mine.
